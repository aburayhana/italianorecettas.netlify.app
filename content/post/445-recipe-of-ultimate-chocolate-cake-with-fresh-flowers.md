Cakes covered in real flowers are awesome. Naked cakes are super popular at the moment, and with those rustic, cutesy cakes have come flowers - big, small, pastel, bold, spiky, flowing…you get the point.. or a rich chocolate cake. Adding fresh flowers on a cake is a beautiful and elegant way to decorate it. Sugar paste flowers can be a lot of fun, but boy are they a lot of work!!

Adding fresh flowers on a cake is a beautiful and elegant way to decorate it. Sugar paste flowers can be a lot of fun, but boy are they a lot of work!! Sugar paste flowers are truly an art form of their own, and a majority of us don&#39;t have the skills (or time) to make them. Flowers are truly my first love, (pun alert!) it&#39;s no wonder I fell in love with Daniel Flores. Decorating a cake with fresh flowers provides such a beautiful, feminine look to any simple cake.
