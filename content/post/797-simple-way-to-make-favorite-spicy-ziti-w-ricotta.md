##### Instructions to make Spicy Ziti w/ Ricotta:

1. Boil noodles until al dente. Drain. Run under cool water to stop the cooking process. Drizzle with olive oil or butter to prevent oxidation.
1. Bring meat sauce to a simmer. Add crushed pepper flakes. Cook 5 minutes.

1. Alternatively, transfer to a casserole dish after adding ricotta cheese, sprinkle mozzarella or parmesean atop, and bake at 400° for approximately 5-10 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
1. Variations; Grilled vegetables, diced tomatoes, roasted or raw bell peppers, roasted or creamed garlic, shallots, habanero, bacon, pancetta, prosciutto, salami, capicola, pepperjack cheese, mushrooms, mozzarella, grilled sausage, goat cheese, eggplant, leeks, ramps, lemon, marjoram, parsley, paprika, chives, scallions, rosemary, thyme, basil, spinach, arugula, asiago, fontina, gruyere, parmigiano reggiano, pecorino, romano, heavy cream, Italian seasoning, celery seed, fennel seed, peppercorn melange, zucchini, yellow squash, capers,


Top with all of the ricotta and half of the sauce. Cook the ziti until not quite al dente. Ricotta cheese is a traditional addition to baked ziti, but I leave it out because it has a tendency to get dry and grainy when baked. I use heavy cream to add richness instead. For the mozzarella cheese, I recommend buying whole milk mozzarella (the kind in plastic-wrapped bricks sold in the dairy case) and shredding it yourself.
