Using pastry brush (or fingers), gently brush edge of each round with beaten egg white. Fold dough round in half to cover filling; press edge together to seal. (To make decorative edge, fold dough over itself so that it forms a rope look.) Empanadas are ideal breakfast fare since they&#39;re hand-held and packed with filling ingredients. Roast beef hash and eggs are the base for this recipe, with the addition of chili sauce, tomatoes, and onions for extra flavor. Brown the ground beef in a frying pan adding the salt and pepper just before done.
