Oh, chicken alfredo﻿: It&#39;s the classic pasta we just can&#39;t seem to get enough of. Of course there are tons of jarred pasta sauces﻿ you can buy, but making alfredo from-scratch is actually so easy. your correct that the version of Fettuccine Alfredo I share is not the traditional Italian version that was created in Rome. The original Alfredo just used butter and cheese to make his dish, and there is a mastery to getting it come out right, with a sauce like texture. That thick creamy sauce that we dip into at Olive Garden and other Italian restaurants (like this Alfredo recipe here) isn&#39;t the original. Instead, the original recipe, which was invented in Rome by a man named, of course, Alfredo, uses only pasta, butter, and Parmesan cheese.
