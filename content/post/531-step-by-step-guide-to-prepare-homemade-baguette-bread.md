Hey everyone, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, baguette bread. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Baguette bread is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. Baguette bread is something which I've loved my whole life. They are fine and they look wonderful.

Check Out Top Brands On eBay. Select Dough cycle, and press Start. These crunchy baguettes feature a chewy interior riddled with holes, and a crisp, deep-golden crust. While it&#39;s a challenge to make &#34;real&#34; baguettes at home, this version is probably as close to an artisan bakery version as you&#39;re going to find.


To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have baguette bread using 5 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Baguette bread:

1. Take 2 cups flour
1. Prepare 1 cup water
1. Make ready 1/4 tsp yeast
1. Take 1 tsp salt
1. Prepare 2 tsp sugar


Place the logs, seam-side down, into the prepared baker. The all-purpose flour that&#39;s already in your pantry is better than bread flour for the authentic Parisian crumb and crispy crust. Baguettes are also called stangenbrot and used in German fast food such as brötchen or paired with a warm stew like Bavarian sausage soup (metzelsuppe) or oxtail soup. I have made this dozens of times and find it to be an excellent no-kneed French Bread recipe.
