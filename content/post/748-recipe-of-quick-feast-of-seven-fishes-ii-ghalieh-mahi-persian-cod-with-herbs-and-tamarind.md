Sprinkle some more sugar-salt mixture over the fish. It is best to cover the fish fillets fully. You may need more sugar and salt.  Cover and chill in the fridge for 24 hrs."
- "Prepare the herbs.  In a skillet over medium heat, add olive oil.   Once the oil is heated up, add parsley, coriander, scallions and mint.   Saute until they start to stick to the bottom of the skillet. It should take about 15 mins.   Add in fenugreek and pepper.   Saute to combine well.   Remove from heat and cover.   Set aside for 5 mins."
- "Prepare the stew.   In another skillet over medium heat, add olive oil.   Once the oil is heated up, add the onion.   Season with salt, pepper and sugar.   Saute until the onion is lightly caramelized. It should take about 10 to 15 mins.   Add in garlic."
- "Saute until aromatic.   Add in turmeric and 1 TBSP of olive oil   Saute until well combined and aromatic.   Add in chili flakes and saute to combine well.   Deglaze the skillet with vegetable stock.   Bring it up to simmer."
- "Allow it to simmer for 1 to 2 mins.   Remove from heat and transfer this stew into the herbs mixture.   Return the skillet back over medium heat.   Add in tamarind.   Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt, pepper and sugar.   Stir to combine well."
- "Add 6 more TBSP of olive oil.   Bring it up to a slow simmer.   Turn the heat down to low and cover.   Continue to simmer for about 15 to 20 mins or until the oil separates and floats to the top.   *Stir occasionally to prevent burning.*"
- "Lastly, add in lemon juice and zest.   Carefully, transfer into a blender.  Add mushroom powder.  Blitz until smooth.   Taste and adjust the seasonings again with salt, pepper, sugar and tamarind.  Transfer back into the skillet."
- "Add about 1/4 cup of water into the blender.  Blitz to clean up all the leftover nooks and crannies.  Pour this water mixture into the sauce to loosen up.  Stir to combine well.  Bring up to a simmer.  Remove from heat and transfer into a large bowl and set aside.   *The sauce should not be as thick as a paste or too loose like a stew; somewhere in the middle.*"
- "Cooking the fish.   After curing for 24 hrs, the sugar-salt mixture should have melted partially.  Wash the fish fillets thoroughly under running water to wash off excess sugar and salt.  Pat them dry with a kitchen towel.  In a skillet over medium heat, add 3 TBSP of oil."
- "Heat the oil up to almost smoking point.   *No need to season the fish as they already been cured.*  Place the fish, skin side down, away from you, onto the skillet.   Using a slotted spatula, gently press the fish down.   *This will prevent the skin from shrinking.*"
- "Tilt and baste the fish with all the liquid.  Once the bottom starts to crisp up, add in ghee, coriander, parsley, scallions and mint.  Tilt and continue basting the fish all the liquid for about 1-2 mins.  Remove from skillet and set aside to rest.  *Do this in batches. Do not crowd the skillet.*"
- "Repeat the process for the remaining fish.   Transfer the sauce onto the serving plate.   Place the fish onto the sauce.   Garnish with some finely chopped green parts of scallions.   Serve immediately."
