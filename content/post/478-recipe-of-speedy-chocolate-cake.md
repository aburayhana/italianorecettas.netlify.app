Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating until smooth after each addition. Our chocolate cake recipes include: easy one-bowl recipes, tiered cakes with frostings and fillings, mini cupcakes, Texas sheet cake, as well as gluten-free chocolate cakes and vegan chocolate cake. The chocolate cake itself is similar to my Chocolate Cake with Cranberry Buttercream, but even a little bit simpler to put together as it calls for oil and cocoa powder rather than melted butter and chocolate. You can feel confident going with either one, depending on whether you&#39;re in a butter creaming mood or not. It can help to line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper cut to fit the pan. 

So that is going to wrap it up for this special food chocolate cake recipe. Thank you very much for reading. I'm sure you will make this at home.
