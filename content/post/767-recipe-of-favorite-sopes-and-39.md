Sopes are very traditional in mexican households. The toppings range from just beans and cheese, to eggs, shredded chicken or beef, picadillo, or even just guacamole. To form the sopes you will need either a tortilla press orflat plate or the bottom of a skillet. A sope is a popular street snack that you&#39;ll find almost everywhere in Mexico! The foundation of a sope is a homemade corn flour shell that we like to think of as a little cup; thicker than a tortilla, the sope shell has the added benefit of a rim around the edge to keep in all of the toppings.
