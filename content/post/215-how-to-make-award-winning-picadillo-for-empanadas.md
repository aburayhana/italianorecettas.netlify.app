recipeingredient:
- "1 pound ground beef 8020 or 7030 is fine  I wouldnt go much leaner than that"
- "1/2 cup finely chopped onion the fine chop is important because you dont want large pieces tearing your pastry"
- "1/2 cup finely chopped bell pepper you can use any color but I like the red or orange because theyre sweeter and look prettier in the filling"
- "2 Tablespoons minced garlic 3 to 4 medium cloves"
- "1/4 cup raisins"
- "8 green pitted olives cut in thirds"
- "3 oz. tomato paste basically half of one of those small cans"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1 teaspoon cumin"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "1 bay leaf or 12 teaspoon crushed bay"
- " neutral oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a 10 or 12 inch pot or pan, sweat the onions, peppers and garlic in 1 Tablespoon of oil over medium low heat until the onions are translucent. This should take 3 to 4 minutes. (Sweating them requires a lower heat than saute, but this results in sweeter and softer vegetables which will also yield better to the dough. Plus the garlic won&#39;t burn even if you throw it in at the same time as the onions and peppers.)"
- "Push the refrito to the side of the pan and add 1 Tablespoon of oil to the center. Give the oil about 10 seconds to heat up and then add your tomato paste right on top of it (this will caramelize the tomato and give it sweetness and depth), along with the cumin, black pepper, bay leaf and salt."
- "Stir to incorporate all the ingredients in the pan, and add the ground beef, spreading it evenly over the surface area of the pan. Because you&#39;re simmering the beef at a lower heat, you&#39;ll find that you don&#39;t have to constantly break up the beef as usually needed when cooking at high heat. Other than a light sizzle right when the meat hits the pan, it shouldn&#39;t be sizzling and/or actively bubbling. If it is, turn the heat down a touch."
- "Simmer the ground beef for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then stir in raisins and simmer another 1 or 2 minutes. (I like to add the raisins toward the end so they can retain their shape and texture. Also, if olives are your thing, this is where you&#39;d add them.)"
- "At the end, you&#39;ll see your picadillo swimming in a little puddle of fat. I drain the fat by pushing all the picadillo over to one side of the pan and resting that side on the burner so the fat can drain to the lower part of the pan. In about 10 minutes, most of the fat should be drained, and you haven&#39;t dirtied another dish in the process."
