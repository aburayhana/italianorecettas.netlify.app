- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "1/3 to 12  teaspoon Salt"
- "1 tsp Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Dry yeast"
- "150 ml Lukewarm water"
recipeinstructions:
- "If using a bread machine, set all ingredients in the machine and automate the process until the first rising by using &#34;bread dough course&#34;."
- "[Kneading] Put all ingredients in a big bowl but separate salt from yeast. Then add lukewarm water. Mix them using cooking chopsticks or spoon."
- "When the dough becomes crumbly, knead by hand. Patiently knead well for 10 minutes until the dough gets resilient and shiny."
- "First Rising: When the dough becomes smooth, make it into a ball.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to rise triple in size."
- "After the first rising is done, divide the dough into 6 pieces. Cover them with a wrung out damp kitchen towel or a bowl, and let it rest for 15 minutes."
- "Shaping: Stretch the dough into an oval shape. You can stretch it gently with your hand without using a rolling pin (that way there is less pressure on the dough)."
- "Take the dough from one end and fold the dough in 3 or roll it up and seal the edges well. Here you can also fill it with bacon or olives."
- "This is a crispy chocolate French baguette filled with chocolate chips. Later you can also make a &#34;condensed milk French baguette&#34; filled with condensed milk + butter."
- "Second rising: To get the crispy texture, spray water on the surface. You can also moisten the dough by using a brush as shown in the photo or back of a spoon."
- "Allow the dough to rise double in size for the second time at a warm place with high humidity. If you are using an oven with bread-rising mode, set it at 40°C for about 30-40 minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 220°C and bake it for about 15 minutes and it&#39;s done (in an electric oven bake at 230°C). Here in the photo, I added dried tomatoes and basil in the dough."
