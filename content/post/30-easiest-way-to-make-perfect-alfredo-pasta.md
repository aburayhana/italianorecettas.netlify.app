It will only make the sauce cheesier and more delicious, so go for it! Add an ounce or two of cream cheese. Cream cheese is naturally thick and creamy, and it has the right flavor profile for Alfredo, too. Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Real alfredo should never (never!) include cream; the silky sauce is the result of an emulsion between the grated cheese, melted butter, and starchy pasta water.
