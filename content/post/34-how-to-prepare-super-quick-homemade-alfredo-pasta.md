The pasta will exude extra starch, adding body to the sauce. It will only make the sauce cheesier and more delicious, so go for it! Add an ounce or two of cream cheese. Cream cheese is naturally thick and creamy, and it has the right flavor profile for Alfredo, too. Alfredo is a creamy, dreamy pan sauce made from butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
