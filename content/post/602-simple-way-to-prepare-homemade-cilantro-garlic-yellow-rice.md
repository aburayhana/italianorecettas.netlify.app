recipeingredient:
- "1/2 a medium onion diced"
- "3 Tablespoons minced garlic about 5 large cloves"
- "1/4 cup chopped cilantro you can use the stems too"
- "1.5 Tablespoons butter I use unsalted"
- "1 teaspoon ground achiote aka annatto"
- "2 cups jasmine rice"
- "2 cups unsalted chicken or vegetable stock"
- "1 cup water"
- "3/4-1 teaspoon kosher salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the butter in a large pot and turn the flame to medium high. When the butter&#39;s just about completely melted, add the onion, garlic, and cilantro to the pot and sauté until the onion is translucent - about 2.5 to 3 minutes. Then add the turmeric and stir to incorporate evenly into the aromatics."
- "Turn the heat down to medium, add the rice, and stir to coat all the grains with the sauteed mixtured. Allow the rice to toast for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will help the grains retain their texture and shape when cooked."
- "Add the stock, water, and salt, and stir gently 3 or 4 times to ensure that all the grains of rice have been separated and distribute the rice in an even layer in the pot. This will ensure that each grain gets completely steamed."
- "Allow the rice to come to a gentle boil for 1 minute, uncovered, on medium heat, and then turn the heat down to medium low, place the lid on the pot slightly askew (leave about 1/2&#34; inch gap on one side), and continue to steam the rice until all the liquid has been absorbed for 2 to 3 minutes."
- "At that point, fluff the rice, allow the steam to release and the rice to cool for about 5 minutes, then serve. (It&#39;s important to fluff the rice shortly after all the water&#39;s been absorbed so the rice doesn&#39;t stick together in clumps."
