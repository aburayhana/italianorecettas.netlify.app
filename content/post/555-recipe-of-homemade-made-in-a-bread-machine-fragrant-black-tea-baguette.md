recipeingredient:
- "60 grams Cake flour"
- "70 grams Bread flour"
- "100 grams Water"
- "10 grams Black tea leaves"
- "3 grams Salt"
- "3 to 4 drops Lemon juice"
- "2 grams Dry yeast"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat water in a small pan. Turn the heat off right before it boils, and add the tea leaves. Set it aside to cool for about 10 minutes. When it&#39;s cooled down, transfer it (including the tea leaves) into the bread machine."
- "Put all other ingredients into the bread machine. Knead for 5 to 7 minutes until the dough is mixed well. Turn it off, and transfer into a bowl."
- "Cover with plastic wrap and leave it aside for the first rising. During wintertime, it took about 1.5 hours to rise until it was 2.5 or 3 times its original volume."
- "Dust your work surface and take out the dough. Bring it together into a ball and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Roll it out long and thin. Take care not to pop the air bubbles."
- "Divide it into 2 portions to make 2 baguettes. Shape it with a bread mat for the second rising, which takes 30 minutes. Watch the time, and preheat the oven (with its tray) at 250℃."
- "Transfer the bread dough with parchment paper onto the hot oven tray. Make slits on the surface, and spray a decent amount of water onto the dough."
- "Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. You can really smell the tea!"
- "It might not really show in the photo, but mine was bumpy with some air holes. That didn&#39;t turn out well... I&#39;m going to try again to get an even bumpier cross-section!!"
