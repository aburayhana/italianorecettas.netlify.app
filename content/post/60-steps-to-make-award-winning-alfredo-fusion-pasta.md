Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, alfredo fusion pasta. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Alfredo Pasta Recipe Heat butter in a pan, add in fresh cream and cook on low flame. When it comes to a boil, then add boiled pasta, salt, black pepper, nutmeg powder and parmesan cheese. Mix the cooked pasta directly into the sauce, not the sauce on top of the pasta: If you mix the cooked pasta inside the sauce, the pasta will better absorb the sauce, and the pasta won&#39;t dry, so combine them together. What is the best tasting store-bought Alfredo sauce?
