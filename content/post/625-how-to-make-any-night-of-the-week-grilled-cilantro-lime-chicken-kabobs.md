Seal the bag and use hands to massage the dressing into the vegetables and fruit. I put the chicken and vegetable kabobs on top of the cilantro lime rice and sprinkled on a little more cilantro. The chicken was moist and flavorful thanks to the marinade it sat in all day. The taste is slightly salty from the soy sauce, a little tangy from the lime juice and rice wine vinegar, and has a kick of garlic and ginger to really amp. Tender chicken thighs are marinated in a flavorful, tangy marinade spiced with cilantro, lime juice and chipotle in adobo sauce, and then we skewer those morsels of chicken with diced peppers, onions and zucchini for a balanced dish on a stick!
