recipeingredient:
- "2 4inch fresh baguettes"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1/2 tbsp butter plus more for buttering the bread"
- "2 tbsp crumbled chevre goat cheese"
- "1 1/2 tbsp finely minced fresh chives"
- "1 dash salt"
- "1 dash pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice each of the baguettes in half."
- "Lightly toast and butter the baguettes and set aside."
- "Whisk the eggs together in a small bowl with several pinches each of salt and pepper."
- "Pour the eggs into a small nonstick frying pan that has not been heated yet."
- "Add the butter in small chunks to the pan with the eggs and turn the heat to medium-low."
- "Cook, stirring constantly in small, quick circles with a wooden spoon or spatula."
- "At first as the eggs warmup and the butter slowly melts, it may not seem like your eggs are cooking at all. It may even seem like they&#39;re getting more liquid. This is fine. It means they&#39;re heating evenly so that they aren&#39;t sticking and cooking over-quickly on the bottom of the pan anywhere. Keep stirring!"
- "Eventually, you&#39;ll see very small opaque clumps forming. Keep on stirring!"
- "The eggs will thicken and become opaque all over and your spoon will start to leave a trail."
- "As soon as the eggs look just a little bit less cooked than you would prefer (they should still be on the wet side) remove the pan from the heat."
- "Off the heat, stir the chevre and chives into the eggs."
- "Taste and adjust the salt and pepper to taste."
- "Divide the eggs between the baguettes and serve."
