One of the things that cost me the most when cooking Chilean dishes is the cuts of meat. At least in beef, the cuts of meat that are typically found in Chile are not the most common in other countries or simply are not found and it&#39;s time to find the closest thing or make friends with a butcher who wants to cut that piece we need. Chileans usually eat four meals a day and the empanada is a common dish throughout Latin America. Empanadas De Pino are the iconic food of Chile.
