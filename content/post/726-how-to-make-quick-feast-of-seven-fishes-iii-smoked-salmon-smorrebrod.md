recipeinstructions:
- "You can use store-bought rye bread or you can check out my previous post for the recipe."
- "Prepare the brine.  Check for any bones on the salmon fillets.  Wash and pat them dry with a kitchen towel.  In a large container, combine all the ingredients together.  Stir until the sugar has dissolved.  Add in the salmon fillets.  Cover with cling film or lid and chill in the fridge for 24 to 48 hrs."
- "Prepare the rub.  Combine everything together.  You can grind the pink peppercorn in pestle &amp; mortar or in a pepper milk.  Set aside."
- "Prepare the sauce.  Mix all the ingredients in a bowl until well combined.  If you are using fresh wasabi or horseradish, grate them freshly. I am just using store-bought wasabi.  Set aside in the fridge until ready to use."
- "Smoking the salmon.   After in the brine for 24 or 48 hrs,   Remove the salmon fillets from the brine.  Place them on a wire cooling rack.  Pat dry with a kitchen towel or paper on both sides.  Sprinkle the rub onto the salmon fillets, both sides too.  Prepare your smoker as per the instructions manual.  I am using Nordic Ware&#39;s Personal Size Stovetop Kettle Smoker.  If you have a outdoor grill and smoker, it will be awesome too."
- "Assembling the toast.  Spread butter onto the rye bread slices, on 1 side only.  You can toast this in a toaster or a skillet, but I decided to smoke the rye bread, buttered side down.  Why not infuse all the flavors from the salmon 1 last time?  Once the bread has been toasted or smoked, transfer onto serving plates, buttered side down."
- "Spread the sauce onto the bread.  You can slice the salmon and lay onto the bread. But I decided to flake them into pieces and place them one by one overlapping one another to sorta create like a fish scales effect.  Place the figs on top of the salmon.  Sprinkle some masago, nori flakes and dill over the top.  Lastly, drizzle sesame oil over the top.  Serve immediately."
