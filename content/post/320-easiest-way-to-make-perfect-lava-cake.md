This preparation helps the baked lava cake release seamlessly from the ramekin onto the plate for serving. The dessert for this particular event was to be individual chocolate cakes, but someone took them out of the ovens too soon and the centers were not cooked enough and still liquefied. Well, there was no time to take them off the plates and bake them more, so the chef simply had his wait staff introduce the dessert as Chocolate &#39;Lava&#39; Cake. Molten lava cakes are the king of chocolate desserts.
