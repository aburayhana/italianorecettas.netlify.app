recipeingredient:
- "2 14 cups unbleached allpurpose flour"
- "1 12 teaspoons salt"
- "1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter cut into 12inch cubes"
- "1 large egg"
- "1/3 cup ice water"
- "1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar"
- "1 Tablespoon Sugar"
- "1 Tablespoon cold solid chicken fat or 1 extra Tablespoon butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sift flour with salt into a large bowl and blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal with some (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. If you don&#39;t have a sifter, just grab handfuls of flour and sift them through your fingers from 6 inches above the bowl OR whisk it all a few times, and your dry ingredients will be incorporated and aerated."
- "Beat together egg, water, and vinegar in a small bowl with a fork. Add to flour mixture, stirring with fork until just incorporated. (Mixture will look shaggy.)"
- "Turn out mixture onto a lightly floured surface and gather together, then knead gently with heel of your hand once or twice, just enough to bring dough together. Form dough into a flat rectangle and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour. If you&#39;re in a hurry, 30 minutes in the back of the freezer will do.  If it&#39;s a warm day, I like to keep the dough I&#39;m not currently working in the fridge. The butter can melt quickly and make the dough challenging to work with."
- "Cut dough into equal sized cubes (about 1+1/2 inches) and roll into balls. Leave 3 or 4 out to roll, and put rest in fridge."
- "Roll into 4&#34;-5&#34; discs, depending on how big you want to make your empanadas."
