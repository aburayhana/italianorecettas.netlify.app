Hello everybody, it is John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, scored baguettes. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Scored Baguettes is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions every day. They are fine and they look wonderful. Scored Baguettes is something that I've loved my entire life.

King Arthur Flour baker Martin Philip demonstrates how to properly cut a baguette. Slash/score the loaves on top as desired. (how to score baguettes here). I usually add a few shallow cuts with a sharp knife. A round boule, for instance, will often get an X-shaped score, or one resembling a hashtag symbol, while a long baguette will traditionally get a series of diagonal slashes.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have scored baguettes using 5 ingredients and 13 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Scored Baguettes:

1. Get 250 grams All purpose flour
1. Take 5 grams Salt
1. Make ready 1 grams Dry yeast
1. Take 1 grams Malt
1. Get 175 grams Water (cold)


Place the sheet pan with the baguettes on the middle rack. According to Suas, long loaves like bâtards and baguettes are traditionally scored parallel to their long axis. This pattern promotes sideways expansion of the loaf, resulting in an oval cross section when. We can choose a single, long slash for a dramatic opening or a series of slashes that slightly overlap each other for multiple ears, as with a baguette.

##### Steps to make Scored Baguettes:

1. Put all ingredients in a bowl, knead with hand for about a minute and a half.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest it for 20 minutes.
1. Knead 1 again for 30 seconds, let it rise for the first time at room temperature (around 25℃) for 2-3 hours.
1. When the dough doubles in size with air bubbles on the surface, the rising is done.
1. Sprinkle flour on a working surface.  Place the dough carefully on the working but make sure not to pop the bubbles. Divide it into two and cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rest for 20 minutes.

1. ★If your oven is not a steam type, score the top of the dough right after you take it out of the refrigerator.  After the cut opens about 2 cm, bake it in the oven.

This pattern promotes sideways expansion of the loaf, resulting in an oval cross section when. We can choose a single, long slash for a dramatic opening or a series of slashes that slightly overlap each other for multiple ears, as with a baguette. With the baguettes on the pans ad ready for some cooking, it is time to score them up. This means using a brush to brush any excess of flour while marking the top with a lame. The baguette will be ready for some coking then.
