This recipe is a Cambodian version of the classic Vietnamese dish banh mi. Slice the pieces lengthwise, without cutting the bread all the way through, (this will keep the yummy ingredients from sliding out). Stuff bread generously with rosemary ham, a thick slice of cheese, and a tablespoon of apricot jam. Spread one cut side with the butter, and the other cut side with the mustard.
