Combine with sautéed peppers and onions, guacamole, and sour cream and then roll up in a warm tortilla! First, squeeze limes, mince garlic, chop cilantro and whisk together with spices and olive oil. I like to do this in a Pyrex measuring cup because it makes it easier to pour over the meat. Making fajitas is super easy and thanks to the delicious cilantro lime marinade you can use just about any cut of beef and still end up with a tasty result. We usually use an inside skirt steak or flank steak because they&#39;re thin, easy to slice, and they grill up quickly.
