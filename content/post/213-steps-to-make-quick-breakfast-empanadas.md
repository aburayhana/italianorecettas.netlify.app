- "Roll dough out to quarter inch thick and cut into 12 six inch rounds."
- "Crack and whisk eggs. Add to the skillet once the ham is warm."
- "Stir continuously. The goal here is to have super creamy and slightly undercooked scrambled eggs."
- "Move the mixture to the bowl the eggs were mixed in. Wipe the skillet with a paper towel and start heating about a quarter inch of oil. I used peanut oil because it&#39;s delicious but canola oil works super good too - used before and it&#39;s my &#39;every day&#39; oil."
- "Load the rounds with the filling, fold and crimp the seam. Cut slits into the top surface for steam to escape."
- "Put the empanadas in the skillet slit side up, don&#39;t over crowd. Once the bottom is golden flip and when otherside is golden remove."
- "Put on a baking sheet in oven on warm until all are done."
- "Eat some right away and freeze the rest. These are super awesome premade breakfasts for camping. Reheat in a cast iron on the campfire and crush it with some coffee and go hit the trail! With salty from the ham and creamy from the constantly stirred eggs you won&#39;t miss cheese in here, but can totally be added. A queso fresco would be great."
