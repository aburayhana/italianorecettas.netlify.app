Am baking a marble wedding cake for next weekend and cannot wait to test out this recipe. Most recipes for marble cake call solely for cocoa powder for the chocolate portion of the cake. I like to add real chocolate as well for a more intense, fudgy flavor; this makes the chocolate swirl portion of the cake taste almost like a brownie. Marble cake is one of my favorite cakes.
