- "To slash the baguette, use a Scissor or a razor blade, keep it at 45¬∞ angle, and make a quick and determined slash across the dough lengthwise. Spray water on the ‚ÄúB√°nh m√¨‚Äù and both sides of the oven. Bake immediately after slashing."
- "After the first 5 minutes, spray water once on the baguettes. 5 minutes later, spray water the second times and the last 5 minute is the 3rd to make crispy crust and soften the inner. Reduce the oven on to 200oC, turn off fan mode and rotate the baking tray to bake the baguettes evenly."
