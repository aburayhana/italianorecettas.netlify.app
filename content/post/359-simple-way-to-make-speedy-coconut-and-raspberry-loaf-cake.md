recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180C fan/160C gas mark 4. Grease a 900g loaf tin. Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla together until fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time with a little of the flour (this is important as it helps stop the mixture splitting)."

- "Bake for 35 minutes, cover and return to the oven for another 20-25 minutes until just cooked and just golden. (You might need to adjust the times for your oven, I had to cover mine after 20 minutes because the top was cooking too quickly)."
- "Leave to cool. Mix together the icing ingredients, drizzle the icing over the cake and sprinkle the coconut on top."

Summer to me screams fresh berries, vanilla cake, homemade lemonade and cream (coconut cream of course). I decided to make a light and fluffy raspberry &amp; coconut loaf cake, topped with coconut whip, fresh berries and coconut. Fold in the rest of the flour and the desiccated coconut, then gently fold in the halved raspberries. Spoon the mixture into the loaf tin, levelling out the top.
