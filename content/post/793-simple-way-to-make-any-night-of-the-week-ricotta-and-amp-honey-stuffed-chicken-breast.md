Serve a fluffy mound of it with bread instead of butter, add it to a bowl of pasta, pair it with fruit, and incorporate it into desserts.

An underrated cheese if ever there was one, ricotta is basically the Muenster or Monterey Jack of spreadable cheese: Sure, it&#39;s great on its own, but its full-throttle potential comes through best.
