- "250 grams ricotta"
- "1 orange  zest"
- "1/2 cup caster sugar"
- "1 egg"
- "1 cup flour if you use plain you need to add 1tsp baking powder"

- "1 oil to deep fry  I ONLY use Rice Bran Oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Grate the zest of one orange and squeeze the juice"
- "Mix ricotta, sugar, flour, egg, zest and juice of the Orange together in a bowl"
- "The mix will be fairly dry so add orange juice until the mixture resembles a thick batter"
- "Heat your oil and drop teaspoon full amounts of the mix into the hot oil....I use a deep fryer for mine and set the temp at 170°C so that the insides cook through.  I only use RICE BRAN OIL when I am cooking as it has a high smoke point, which means it does not burn (unlike olive oil and other oils) and is NOT carcinogenic at high temps"
- "When the balls are golden brown/blonde brown remove them from the oil"
- "Drizzle honey over a pile of fritters and you can sprinkle icing sugar over the top....if you have some extra ricotta you can dollop some onto the fritters AND you can also serve with some candied orange zest (I didn&#39;t have any in my humble kitchen)"
