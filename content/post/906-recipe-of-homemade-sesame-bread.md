Sesame French Bread Homemade French bread isn&#39;t at all difficult to make, and it&#39;s perfect alongside Italian foods. Immediately before you put the loaf in the oven, brush it again with the egg white and sprinkle the sesame seeds or flax seeds on. This is inspired by Cuban bread, which requires a different baking method than most yeast breads; it undergoes one rise and is placed in an unheated oven (the dough rises a little more as the oven heats up). For best results, give this bread soon after baking.
