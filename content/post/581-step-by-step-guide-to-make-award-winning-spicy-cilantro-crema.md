Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, spicy cilantro crema. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Our Test kitchen created this light and tangy Cilantro-Lime Crema to pair with our delicious Brisket-and-Black Bean Chili, but it works just as well served alongside almost any chili recipe or spicy stew, or dolloped atop beef, chicken, vegetable, or seafood tacos. Made with sour cream and mayonnaise and flavored with fresh chopped cilantro and fresh lime zest and juice, this crema comes. Turn an ordinary taco into something special with this creamy, herb-studded sauce in place of plain sour cream. It&#39;s traditionally made with Mexican crema, a tangy-sweet cultured cream; if it&#39;s available in your area, it can be used in place of the sour cream.

Spicy cilantro crema is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions daily. Spicy cilantro crema is something that I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

I prefer to use a full fat sour cream as it&#39;s much richer, but you can use low fat if you prefer. Cilantro lime Crema goes well with foods like tacos, tortilla soup or chili. It helps tame down the heat from some of those spicy foods. I love it when I find that little bit of creamy goodness in a bite of peppery chili or a spicy taco.
