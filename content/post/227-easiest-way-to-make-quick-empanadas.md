recipeingredient:
- "2 cup masa"
- "1 1/2 cup water"
- "3 medium potatoes"
- "1 lb picadillo  Puerto Rican meat filling or filling of choice"
- " shredded sharp cheddar optional"
- " vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the potatoes and boil them whole until fork tender. Drain and set aside to cool."
- "If you don&#39;t know what picadillo is you can find recipes all over the net for it. It&#39;s a Puerto Rican meat mixture and is amazing. Anyways, mix the water and masa together well. If it&#39;s too dry add a little more water if it&#39;s too wet add a little more masa. You don&#39;t want the dough to be sticky or crumbly."
- "Dice the potatoes up then add it to the picadillo mixture."
- "Grab about a golf ball sized piece of the masa, roll it into a ball then place on a piece of parchment paper, place another piece of parchment paper on top. Roll the dough out to about the thickness of a corn tortilla, maintaining a round shape. This process would be much faster with a tortilla press, however I do not own one so this is my method."
- "Place about a 1/4 cup of the filling onto one half of the dough, fold the other half over and pinch seams together or use a fork. I personally don&#39;t do either, but it&#39;s hard to explain how I do it,it almost looks like it&#39;s twisting around the edge."
- "In a skillet of oil fry the empanada over medium high heat until golden on each side. Serve with your favorite meat and rice and enjoy!"
