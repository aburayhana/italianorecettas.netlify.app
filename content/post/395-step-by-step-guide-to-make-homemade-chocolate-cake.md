The chocolate cake itself is similar to my Chocolate Cake with Cranberry Buttercream, but even a little bit simpler to put together as it calls for oil and cocoa powder rather than melted butter and chocolate. You can feel confident going with either one, depending on whether you&#39;re in a butter creaming mood or not. It can help to line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper cut to fit the pan.
