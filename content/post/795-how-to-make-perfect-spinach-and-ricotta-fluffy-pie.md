recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven for 220°C (430F)."
- "Unwrap the pastry and roll it on a flat surface. If needed, roll it with a rolling pin to match the size of your baking pan. Place the baking paper in your baking pan and cover with the pastry. Pull the edges up a bit - these will form the sides of the pie. Make few holes in the pie with a fork so that the dough is able to breath."
- "Put the dough in the oven for approximately 15 minutes or until the pastry is goldenish. In case the dough makes bubbles, pierce it with the fork."
- "While the dough is in the oven, prepare the spinach filling. Thoroughly wash the spinach leaves and let the dry. Cut the onion in the small cubes and sautee it in the pan on a fair amount of olive oil."
- "Add spinach leaves, cover the pan and leave it for a while until it diminishes in volume."

- "Cut the onions into slices and use the as a base layer on your baked pastry."
- "Cover the onions with spinach and ricotta. Make two holes and fill them with eggs."
- "Put back in the oven for another 10 - 15 minutes. I used grill function for this as it cooks the eggs faster. Once the eggs are cooked (or less cooked, if you prefer them being a little bit liquid), take out of the oven and let the pie to cool down for a minute or two. (If you use a grill function, watch the pie thoroughly... I didn&#39;t and it burnt on the side a little bit. :-) )"
- "Serve and enjoy your wonderful meal. :-) I served the pie with a delicious pak choi salad - see my another recipe, which is easy peasy."
