Carrots, bell peppers, onions, and broccoli are tossed with garlic cloves, salt, pepper, and creamy Alfredo sauce for a flavor combination you can&#39;t miss. Served over hot noodles, this dish is perfect any night of the week. We don&#39;t use cream, milk, garlic, onions or other strange ingredients; we use only guanciale, eggs, pecorino cheese, and lots of black pepper (carbonaro is the Italian for coal miner). Early incarnations of this dish call for an Alfredo-like sauce, which I find too heavy and overwhelming for tender spring vegetables. Instead, brighten the starch-thickened sauce with some lemon and a handful of Parmesan cheese.
