Hey everyone, it is Louise, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, fish and shrimp ceviche. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Have ice water ready on the side. Combine with fish and toss with onion, ginger, garlic, hot pepper, celery. The shrimp and fish I used for this ceviche was thicker, so it takes a little longer to cook. Use fish: Lean white fish cut into small chunks (such as cod, talapia, mahi mahi, snapper, bass, halibut) can be used instead of shrimp.
